When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when id want others to collaborate on my project
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
we want to have one commit per logical change.. if git does that automatically then wed have many unnecessary commits
