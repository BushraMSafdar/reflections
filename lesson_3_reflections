When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when id want others to collaborate on my project
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
we want to have one commit per logical change.. if git does that automatically then wed have many unnecessary commits
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forking is one u make a copy of a git repository into another git repository. cloning is one when u make a copy of a git repository or a local repository into another local repository. branching is one u add new features separately in the same repository.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
its benefit is that it would make merges of the branches easier
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
